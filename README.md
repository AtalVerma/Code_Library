## 📝 Project Description
Code Snippet Library is a simple and efficient platform designed to store and manage code snippets in one place. Instead of searching through old files or remembering everything, users can add code snippets with titles, descriptions, and language tags.

The application includes:

Search bar to instantly find snippets by keywords

Language filter to sort snippets (JS, Python, C, C++, HTML/CSS, etc.)

Responsive layout that works on laptop and mobile

All snippets are saved using LocalStorage, so the data stays even after refreshing the page — no database required.

This project is ideal for students and developers who want a personal coding reference library.
